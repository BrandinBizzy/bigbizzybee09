        My name is Brandin Harris, and I am currently a sophomore at BCIT Westampton, (class of 2027). I was born on February 23rd, 2009 in HTX, Texas. As a person who has grew up around technology,
        I decided that I should possibly consider doing something in the technology field. This leads me to where I am at now. As a student with interest in Computer Science, I am excited about the opportunities 
        within this field. My passion for technology and computing motivates me to keep going in this field. Beyond my academic interests, I am an 
        athlete with a strong passion for sports as well. I actively participate in basketball and track and field, where I enjoy the competitiveness with my teammates. Playing basketball allows me to have better teamwork and good communication, 
        while running helps me maintain physical fitness and discipline.I also constantly do work related to IT to enhance my skills and knowledge in technology, whether through personal projects, online courses, or collaboration with peers. My goal is to be a 
        knowledgible person in IT work while also working on stuff in sports, aiming to get a scholarship. Overall, I am dedicated to making the most of my next 3 years here and excited about my future.
